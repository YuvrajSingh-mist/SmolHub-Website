## Tech Stack

**Client:** Flutter, HTML, CSS JavaScript, Bootstrap

**Backend:** Flask, Python, Django, Keras, OpenCV, YOLOv8

**Storage:** Firebase Firestore, Realtime Database, SQLite

**Other Tools:** GCP VM Instances, Mapbox, Render, Docker

## Features

1. **Categorization of Trash w/ Deep Learning**

Used Transfer Learning on the VGG19 model along with a custom dataset combined with open-sourced and hand-labelled ones.

2. **Reward System**

-> Earn points for each **category** and **count** (using YOLOv8) of litter collected during plogging and once the garbage collected has been verified by the Garbage Collector on-site (so the garbage collected does reach to a factory through the worker), points are sent.

-> Redeem points in the 'Store' for gift cards.

-> The categorization of garbage is intended for smoothing out the process of post-garbage collected by already organizing the garbage as much as possible.


3. **Map Location**

Genetic Algorithm automatically finds the best route for the locations of trash sites marked as 'Favourite' so as to cater to their jogging times (up to 3 max).

4. **Blog System**

Share plogging experiences, environmental tips, and success stories through the integrated blog system, bringing the community together and breaking the social stigma of how 'garbage collectors' are perceived.
