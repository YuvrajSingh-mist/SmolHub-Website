* **Role**: Solo designer & developer

* **Vision/Goal**: Create a fast, minimalist, and data‑driven home for my research, projects, and interactive playgrounds that scales cleanly as content grows.

- **Data‑driven content**  
  - Powered by `_data` JSON/YAML; content updates without touching templates

- **Projects & SmolHub Playground**  
  - Filterable grid, search, and tag chips for quick discovery  
  - Rich cards via reusable Liquid partials

- **Paper Replications**  
  - Clean index and detail templates for implementations from scratch

- **UX & Performance**  
  - Responsive layout, focus states, keyboard‑friendly interactions  
  - Lean assets, semantic HTML, meta tags, and sensible SEO defaults

* **Tech Stack**:  
  **Core**: Jekyll, Liquid, SCSS, vanilla JS  
  **Data**: YAML/JSON in `_data`, content collections (`_talks`, `_smolhub`)  
  **Tooling**: Small Python/Node scripts for data generation and markdown creation
