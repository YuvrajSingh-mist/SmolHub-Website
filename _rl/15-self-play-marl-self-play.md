## Overview

**Self-Play** is a powerful training paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning where agents learn by competing against themselves or other agents from the same population. This approach has been instrumental in achieving superhuman performance in games like Go, Chess, and Dota 2. Our implementation focuses on competitive environments like Pong, where agents learn optimal strategies through continuous self-improvement.

## Self-Play Theory

### Core Concept
Self-play operates on the principle that an agent can improve by playing against increasingly skilled versions of itself. This creates a natural curriculum where the agent's opponent (itself) becomes progressively stronger, forcing continuous improvement.

### Key Mechanisms

#### 1. Population-Based Learning
- Multiple agents form a population
- Agents compete against each other
- Best strategies are preserved and improved

#### 2. Opponent Sampling
- Agents play against current and historical versions
- Prevents overfitting to a single opponent
- Maintains diverse strategy exploration

#### 3. Strategy Evolution
- Successful strategies are reinforced
- Novel strategies emerge through exploration
- Continuou
## Implementation Details

### Network Architecture

#### Shared Policy Network
```python
class Agent(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, action_space):
        # Shared CNN feature extractor
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            layer_init(nn.Conv2d(6, 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4)),
            nn.ReLU(),
            layer_init(nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2)),
            nn.ReLU(),
            layer_init(nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1)),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Flatten(),
            layer_init(nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 512)),
            nn.ReLU(),
        )
        # Actor and Critic heads
        self.actor = layer_init(nn.Linear(512, action_space), std=0.01)
        self.critic = layer_init(nn.Linear(512, 1), std=1.0)
```

#### Observation Processing
- **Input**: 6-channel observation (4-frame stack + agent indicator)
- **Preprocessing**: Grayscale, resize to 84×84, frame stacking
- **Output**: Action probabilities and state value

### Training Process

1. **Environment Setup**
   - PettingZoo Atari Pong-v3 environment
   - Two agents compete in each episode
   - Shared policy network for both agents

2. **Experience Collection**
   - 16 parallel environments
   - 128 steps per rollout
   - Store observations, actions, rewards, values

3. **Self-Play Training**
   - Agents compete against each other
   - Winner gets positive reward, loser gets negative
   - Policy updates based on competitive outcomes

4. **Opponent Management**
   - Current policy serves as opponent
   - Historical policies can be used for diversity
   - Prevents overfitting to current strategy

## Supported Environments

### 1. Pong (Atari)
- **Environment**: `pong_v3`
- **Task**: Competitive Pong game
- **Actions**: 6 discrete actions (NOOP, FIRE, RIGHT, LEFT, FIRE_RIGHT, FIRE_LEFT)
- **Observations**: 6-channel image (4-frame stack + agent indicator)
- **Reward**: +1 for winning, -1 for losing

### 2. Custom Competitive Environments
- **Extensible**: Framework supports other competitive games
- **Modular**: Easy to adapt to new environments
- **Scalable**: Supports multiple agents and teams

## Usage

### Installation
```bash
pip install torch pettingzoo[atari] supersuit wandb tqdm imageio opencv-python gymnasium
```

### Training Commands

#### Main Self-Play Training
```bash
cd MARL
python train.py --env_id pong_v3 --total_timesteps 15000000
```

#### Alternative Self-Play Driver
```bash
cd MARL/Self Play
python self_play.py --env_id pong_v3 --total_timesteps 15000000
```

### Key Hyperparameters

```python
# Self-Play Configuration
lr = 2.5e-4                    # Learning rate
num_envs = 16                  # Parallel environments
max_steps = 128               # Rollout length
PPO_EPOCHS = 4                # PPO update epochs
clip_coeff = 0.1              # PPO clipping coefficient
ENTROPY_COEFF = 0.01          # Entropy regularization
total_timesteps = 15000000    # Total training steps
```

### Interactive Play

#### Human vs AI
```bash
python play.py "pt files/Pong-MARL.pt"
```

**Controls:**
- `W` or `↑`: Move right
- `S` or `↓`: Move left
- `F`: Fire
- `D`: Fire right
- `A`: Fire left
- `Q`: Quit

```bash
python play.py "pt files/Pong-MARL.pt" --ai_vs_ai
```
