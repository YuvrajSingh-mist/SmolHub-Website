Implementation of MuJoCo reinforcement learning algorithm

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Environment**: MuJoCo
- **Category**: Other

This directory contains PPO implementations specifically for MuJoCo continuous control environments. These environments represent some of the most challenging continuous control tasks in reinforcement learning, requiring sophisticated policy learning to coordinate multiple joints and maintain dynamic stability.

## Overview

MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) is a physics engine designed for robotics and biomechanics simulation. The environments implemented here focus on locomotion tasks that require:

- Complex multi-joint coordination
- Dynamic stability and balance
- Continuous action spaces with high dimensionality
- Robust policy learning for physical simulation

## Environments

PPO has been successfully applied to several challenging MuJoCo continuous control environments:

## Implementation Details

All MuJoCo implementations use:
- **Continuous PPO**: Adapted for continuous action spaces using Gaussian policies
- **Clipped Surrogate Objective**: For stable policy updates
- **Value Function Learning**: Separate critic network for state value estimation

### Hyperparameters
The MuJoCo environments typically require:
- Lower learning rates (1e-4 to 3e-4) for stable learning
- Longer training episodes due to environment complexity
- Careful entropy coefficient tuning for exploration vs exploitation
- Higher GAE lambda values for better value estimation
