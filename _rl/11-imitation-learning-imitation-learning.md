Implementation of Imitation Learning reinforcement learning algorithm

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Environment**: Custom Environment
- **Category**: Imitation Learning


This project implements core Imitation Learning algorithms—including Behavioral Cloning (BC) and Dataset Aggregation (DAgger)—for learning policies from expert demonstrations in a GridWorld environment. The agent learns to imitate expert behavior by training a neural network to predict actions given states, and can further improve using interactive data collection (DAgger).


## 🎯 Overview

Imitation Learning is a family of techniques where agents learn to perform tasks by mimicking expert behavior. This project includes:

- **Behavioral Cloning (BC):** A supervised learning approach where a policy is trained on expert state-action pairs to directly imitate the expert.
- **DAgger (Dataset Aggregation):** An interactive algorithm that iteratively collects new data by letting the agent act and querying the expert for corrections, reducing compounding errors.

The learned policies can then be evaluated in the environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch tqdm wandb
```


### Running the Code

#### Behavioral Cloning
```bash
python BC.py
```
This will:
1. Load expert demonstrations from `expert_data/ckpt0.pkl`
2. Train a policy network using behavioral cloning
3. Evaluate the policy every 100 episodes
4. Log training progress to Weights & Biases

#### DAgger
```bash
python DAgger.py
```
This will:
1. Initialize with expert demonstrations
2. Iteratively collect new data by running the agent and querying the expert
3. Aggregate datasets and retrain the policy
4. Evaluate and log progress

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### PolicyNet
- **Input**: One-hot encoded state (2500 dimensions)
- **Hidden Layers**: 
  - FC1: 2500 → 128 (ReLU)
  - FC2: 128 → 64 (ReLU)
- **Output**: 4 action logits (up, down, left, right)

### Training Details
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss
- **Optimizer**: Adam (lr=2.5e-4)
- **Batch Processing**: Trains on individual expert episodes

## 📊 Monitoring with Weights & Biases

The code automatically logs:
- **train_loss**: Cross-entropy loss for each training episode
- **eval_reward**: Average reward during evaluation
- **episode**: Training episode number
- **hyperparameters**: Learning rate, architecture details

## 🔧 Configuration

Modify the `Config` class in `BC.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class Config:
    lr: float = 2.5e-4                    # Learning rate
    project_name: str = "behavioral-cloning"  # WandB project name
    run_name: str = "bc-gridworld"           # WandB run name
```


## 📈 Key Components

### BC Class
- `__init__()`: Initializes policy network, optimizer, and WandB logging
- `train()`: Trains on expert state-action pairs for one episode
- `evaluate()`: Evaluates policy performance in the environment

### DAgger Class
- `__init__()`: Initializes policy, expert, and data buffers
- `collect_data()`: Runs the current policy, queries expert for corrections, and aggregates new data
- `train()`: Retrains the policy on the aggregated dataset
- `evaluate()`: Evaluates policy performance in the environment

### Plots

- BC and DAgger training losses and evaluation rewards are logged to Weights & Biases for visualization.

### Helper Functions
- `sample_action()`: Samples actions from policy logits (greedy/stochastic)
- `one_hot_encode()`: Converts state integers to one-hot vectors

### BC Training Loop Example
```python
curr = 0
for i, length in enumerate(timestep_lens):
    # Extract episode data
    expert_states = all_states[curr: curr + length]
    expert_actions = all_actions[curr: curr + length]
    # Train on this episode
    loss = model.train(expert_states, expert_actions)
    # Evaluate every 100 episodes
    if i % 100 == 0:
        rew = model.evaluate()
        print(f"Episode {i}, Eval Reward: {rew}")
    curr += length
```

### DAgger Training Loop Example
```python
for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    # Collect data using current policy and expert
    new_states, new_actions = model.collect_data()
    # Aggregate with previous data
    dataset.add(new_states, new_actions)
    # Retrain policy
    model.train(dataset.states, dataset.actions)
    # Evaluate
    if iteration % 5 == 0:
        rew = model.evaluate()
        print(f"DAgger Iteration {iteration}, Eval Reward: {rew}")
```

## 🎮 Environment Details

- **GridWorld**: 50x50 grid environment
- **States**: 2500 possible positions (50×50)
- **Actions**: 4 discrete actions (up, down, left, right)
- **Evaluation**: Uses batched environments (128 parallel instances)

## 📊 Expert Data Format

The expert data (`ckpt0.pkl`) contains:
- `states`: Flattened array of all expert states
- `actions`: Flattened array of all expert actions  
- `timestep_lens`: Length of each expert episode

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

- **Average Reward**: Mean reward per episode across evaluation runs
- **Training Loss**: Cross-entropy loss between predicted and expert actions



**Note**: Make sure to have expert demonstrations and proper environment setup before running the code.
