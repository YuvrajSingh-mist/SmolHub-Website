## Overview

**Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO)** is a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that extends the single-agent PPO algorithm to multi-agent settings. Unlike centralized training approaches, IPPO allows each agent to learn independently while sharing observation processing capabilities.

## Algorithm Theory

### Core Concept
IPPO operates on the principle that each agent can learn an optimal policy independently while sharing a common observation encoder. This approach is particularly effective in cooperative multi-agent environments where agents need to coordinate but can benefit from independent learning.

### Key Components

#### 1. Independent Learning
- Each agent maintains its own policy network (actor) and value network (critic)
- Agents learn independently without direct policy sharing
- Shared observation processing reduces computational overhead

#### 2. Proximal Policy Optimization
- Uses PPO's clipped objective function to ensure stable policy updates
- Trust region optimization prevents large policy changes
- Entropy regularization encourages exploration

#### 3. Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Computes advantages using GAE with λ=0.95
- Reduces variance in policy gradient estimates
- Balances bias-variance trade-off in advantage estimation

## Implementation Details

### Network Architecture

#### Shared Observation Encoder
```python
class SharedEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, observation_dim):
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            layer_init(nn.Linear(observation_dim, 64)),
            nn.Tanh(),
            layer_init(nn.Linear(64, 64)),
            nn.Tanh(),
        )
```

#### Agent-Specific Heads
```python
class Actor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, observation_dim, action_dim):
        # Shared feature extraction
        self.network = nn.Sequential(...)
        # Agent-specific actor head
        self.actor = layer_init(nn.Linear(64, action_dim), std=0.01)

class Critic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, observation_dim):
        # Shared feature extraction
        self.network = nn.Sequential(...)
        # Agent-specific critic head
        self.critic = layer_init(nn.Linear(64, 1), std=1.0)
```

### Training Process

1. **Environment Interaction**
   - Multiple parallel environments (15 by default)
   - Each agent interacts independently
   - Observations are processed through shared encoder

2. **Experience Collection**
   - Rollout length: 128 steps per environment
   - Store observations, actions, rewards, values, log probabilities
   - Compute advantages using GAE

3. **Policy Updates**
   - PPO epochs: 4
   - Minibatch size: 1920 (15 envs × 128 steps)
   - Learning rate: 2.5e-4 with linear annealing

4. **Optimization**
   - Adam optimizer with gradient clipping (0.5)
   - Orthogonal initialization for stable training
   - Entropy coefficient: 0.001 for exploration

## Supported Environments

### 1. Simple Spread (Discrete Actions)
- **Environment**: `simple_spread_v3`
- **Task**: Cooperative navigation where agents must cover landmarks
- **Actions**: Discrete (5 actions per agent)
- **Observations**: Vector observations with agent positions and landmark locations
- **Reward**: Cooperative reward based on landmark coverage

### 2. Simple Tag (Competitive)
- **Environment**: `simple_tag_v3`
- **Task**: Competitive tagging game
- **Actions**: Discrete actions for movement and tagging
- **Observations**: Vector observations with agent positions
- **Reward**: Competitive rewards for taggers and runners

### 3. Continuous Control
- **Environment**: `simple_spread_v3` (continuous variant)
- **Task**: Same cooperative navigation with continuous actions
- **Actions**: Continuous 2D movement vectors
- **Observations**: Same vector observations
- **Reward**: Same cooperative reward structure
