*Note: FrozenLake 8x8 is a significantly more challenging environment than the standard 4x4 version, with 64 discrete states instead of 16. The stochastic slippery dynamics make exploration particularly difficult, as the agent often slips in unintended directions. RND's intrinsic motivation is crucial here, encouraging systematic exploration of the larger grid world. The prediction error helps the agent discover safe paths through the expanded maze while understanding the stochastic nature of the environment, leading to robust policies that can navigate the complex 8x8 layout.*en exploration in reinforcement learning.

## Overview

Random Network Distillation (RND) is an exploration method that generates intrinsic rewards by measuring the agent's ability to predict the output of a randomly initialized neural network. The key insight is that prediction error correlates with novelty - states that are visited less frequently are harder to predict, leading to higher intrinsic rewards and encouraging exploration.

Key features of this implementation:
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Uses prediction error as curiosity signal
- **PPO Integration**: Combines RND with PPO for stable policy optimization
- **Dual Advantage Estimation**: Separate advantages for extrinsic and intrinsic rewards
- **Normalization**: Running normalization of intrinsic rewards for stable training
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Works with discrete and continuous control tasks

## How RND Works

RND consists of two neural networks:
1. **Target Network**: A randomly initialized network that remains fixed throughout training
2. **Predictor Network**: A learnable network that tries to predict the target network's output

The prediction error serves as an intrinsic reward:
```
intrinsic_reward = ||predictor(state) - target(state)||²
```

This encourages the agent to visit novel states where the prediction error is high.

        super(TargetNet, self).__init__()
        # Randomly initialized, never updated
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_space, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 256)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(256, 256)
```

#### Predictor Network
```python
class PredictorNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_space):
        super(PredictorNet, self).__init__()
        # Learnable network
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_space, 256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 256)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(256, 256)
```

## Key Benefits of RND

1. **Simple Implementation**: No need for complex count-based exploration
2. **Scalable**: Works with high-dimensional state spaces
3. **Stable**: Prediction error provides consistent exploration signal
4. **Task-Agnostic**: Doesn't require domain knowledge about the environment

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Intrinsic Reward Explosion
- **Problem**: Intrinsic rewards become too large, overwhelming extrinsic rewards
- **Solution**: Use running normalization and carefully tune `INT_COEFF`

### Insufficient Exploration
- **Problem**: Agent doesn't explore enough novel states
- **Solution**: Increase `INT_COEFF` or improve network architecture

### Training Instability
- **Problem**: Training becomes unstable due to conflicting objectives
- **Solution**: Balance `EXT_COEFF` and `INT_COEFF`, use smaller learning rates
