Experience

University of Maryland | Research intern

Dec 2024 – Feb 2025

• Worked on UI/UX2Code generation with primary focus on creation of a robust dataset for the VLM models to be

fine-tuned upon.

• Scraped 100+ websites of static web pages and collected their commit history and corresponding webpage layouts

to create a dataset of 200+ records.

IISER, Kolkata | Summer Research intern

May 2024 – May 2025

• With Prof. Kripabandhu Ghosh, we created a dataset of 40k, humanely-verified, stance-analysed famous sports

controversies with applied stance detection

• Scraped YouTube comments for famous sports controversies ranging from cricket to football.
• Utilized LLMs like Llama-3.1/3.2, Mistral-7b, Qwen-2.5 under zero/few-shot prompt to create the dataset

post-human verification of the generated labels..

• Fine-tuned LLMs Reasoning (distilled models) and Non-Reasoning LLMs on the humanely verified dataset. Boost

of 30% compared to base LLM.

AIISC | Research intern

March. 2024 – July 2024

• Worked with Prof. Amitava Das on Prevention of Hallucination in LLMs
• Part of the data collection team- Performed web scraping of news articles and posts. Generated synthetic data

using various open-source LLMs.

• Tagged LLM-generated synthetic data with entities using GLiNER and other open-source models.

Clinical AI Assistance | Research intern

Dec. 2023 – March 2024

• Worked closely with the Research Team for the main project, building dataset and testing the model’s generated

output with other Text Generative tools like GPT etc.

• Used HuggingFace API to use various LLMs to test our generated response to the original ones
• Data Gathering and cleaning and performing Data Analysis on the generated output to view model’s efficiency

Projects

Paper/Architecture Replication from Scratch using PyTorch | GitHub Repository

2024

∗ Tools: Pytorch, HuggingFace Spaces (for deployment of smaller versions of replicated models), Git, Github

StoryLlama | A Smaller Language Model for Bedtime Stories! | 2025

∗ Description: Pretrained a Llama based decoder only (90M) model implemented from scratch in PyTorch and
trained it on 4.2B tokens of TinyStories using DDP (torchrun) for 5k steps with gradient accumulation of 0.5M
tokens

∗ Result: Train Loss: 1.43 Val loss: 1.45

SmolLlama | A 123 M model | 2025

∗ Description: Pretrained a Llama based decoder only model implemented from scratch in PyTorch and trained it

on 10B tokens of FineWeb dataset using DDP (torchrun) with gradient accumulation of 0.5M tokens. It was
followed by SFT (Instruction following) and DPO.

∗ Result - Pretraining: : Train Loss: 3.77 (stagnated) Val loss: 3.80 (stagnated)
∗ Result - SFT: : Train Loss: 1.01 Val loss: 1.39

FarmGenie (GeoHack 2024) | Empowering farmers with real-time insights and expert guidance via AI-driven space

2024

∗ Role: Backend (AI/ML Integration)
∗ Vision/Goal: In the ever-evolving agricultural landscape, farmers often face challenges in accessing up-to-date

knowledge and resources to improve their farming practices. To address this, we have developed a comprehensive
product that leverages the power of LLMs as Experts and Agents to create an interactive platform for farmers.
∗ Solution: Our platform utilizes LLMs and a Mixture of Expert (MoE) approaches to provide precise guidance on
soil management, plant disease identification, and irrigation techniques. Built as a scalable web application with a
Next.js frontend and backend, and supported by a Redis queue and multiple worker nodes, FarmGenie ensures
robust performance. The system’s multilingual support, interactive community forum, and up-to-date knowledge
base facilitate seamless, expert-driven assistance for both new and experienced farmers.

∗ Tools: Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Next.js, Flask, Python, Langchain, GeminiPro API, peft , bitsandbytes,

transformers, PostgreSQL, FAISS, Pinecone, MySQL, Unsloth, GCP, Docker, Vercel, DigitalOcean

PlogPayouts (Google Solution Challenge ’24) | AI-driven Plogging System

2024

∗ Role: Backend (AI/ML+Server)
∗ Vision/Goal: To bring about an effective change in the garbage collection process and also tackle the social
stigma regarding the position and work of garbage collectors to harbour a cleaner and greener environment,
working together without any social differences.

∗ Solution: Detection, classification and counting of garbage collected by the users for which redeemable coins are
rewarded in exchange for their hard work, lowering the need for post-garbage processing while being the garbage
collectors themselves doing a part of their daily activity-jogging.

∗ Tools: Flutter, HTML, CSS JavaScript, Bootstrap, Flask, Python , Django , Keras, OpenCV, YOLOv8, Firebase

Firestore, Realtime Database, Storage, GCP APIs,Mapbox, Render, Docker
