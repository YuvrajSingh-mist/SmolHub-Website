### Hyperparameters
| Parameter                | Value      | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `epochs`                 | 10         | Total training epochs.                                                      |
| `batch_size`             | 128        | Samples per batch.                                                          |
| `block_size`             | 40         | Context window length for attention.                                        |
| `embeddings_dims`        | 288        | Embedding dimension (must be divisible by `no_of_heads`).                   |
| `no_of_heads`            | 6          | Attention heads in multi-head attention.                                    |
| `no_of_decoder_layers`   | 6          | Transformer decoder layers.                                                 |
| `dropout`                | 0.1        | Dropout rate for regularization.                                            |
| `max_lr`                 | 6e-4       | Peak learning rate (use with learning rate scheduler).                      |
| `weight_decay_optim`     | 0.1        | Weight decay for AdamW (consider reducing to `0.01` if unstable).           |
| `sr`                     | 16000      | Audio sampling rate (fix conflict with `SAMPLING_RATE=480000` if needed).   |

### Dataset

[Gigaspeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/speechcolab/gigaspeech) 

### Frameworks:
**Pytorch**

### Epochs/Steps
Steps (train) = 1500

Val iterations = every 50 steps

### Loss Curves

Looks like 25 hours isnt enough thus started to overfit!
